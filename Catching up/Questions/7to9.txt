Set 7 Questions:

1.	  act , getActors, processActors,getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation.

2.	getting an actor, processing the actor, getting the location to move, selecting the move location, then moving to that location with processed actor.

3.	Subclasses dont override the getActors method as these subclasses do not declare separate getActors methods.

4.	A critter could process actors by analyzing instances of objects and other actors (obstacles), acting accordingly by removing itself from the grid, and it could also set its color to that of another object adjacent to it.

5.	to act, critter must use processActor, selectMoveLocation, and the makeMove method.

6.	There is no Critter constructor because Critter uses Actor.

Set 8 Questions:

1.	Act calls getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, and makeMove. ChameleonCritter changes processActors and makeMove. so act for ChameleonCritter is different than act for Critter

2.	super is called by the chameleon critter so that it can obtain information from its parent class in order to have makemove do basic functions of a makeMove from any other critter

3.	By changing makeMove to drop flowers in the old location. A Location keeps track of the current location, and the critter only places flower if it moved 

4.	ChameleonCritter does not use a new behavior for getActors because it doesnt need it 

5.	Actor class has getLocation method.

6.	critters access their grid by calling getGrid

Set 9 Questions:

1.	CrabCritter doesnt need to override processActors. It processes its actors by eating neighboring actors returned from getActors.

2.	Crab Critter's getActors only gets neighbors in front of the crab critter, and its NE and NW locations. They are removed from the grid.

3.	This method is called to bring in directions. This array has the directions of "edible" candidates. The method uses this array to determine valid adjacent locations of the critter. 

4.	(4,3), (4,4), (4,5)

5.	same: both randomly choose next location
	different: Crab critter only moves left or right.

6.	If loc in makeMove = current location, it turns instead.

7.	The processActors method only removes actors that are neither rocks nor critters. A CrabCritter cannot eat another critter.
