Part 2:

1. sideLength is the amount of steps a boxBug traverses on its axis.

2. steps records how many times the bug has moved.
 
3. sideLength= 90 degree turn. BoxBug needs to call turn method twice to equal
a sideLength.

4. BoxBug inherits move from the Bug class

5. Yes. side length is predetermined.

6. Yes, if an object obstructs the BoxBug's path, it will turn and start a new path.

7. Initially, steps = zero. Steps also = zero when steps = sideLength
